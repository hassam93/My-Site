        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code almost six months ago, for a career change. Starting off by watching YouTube tutorials, and reading through the information available on W3Schools, and FreeCodeAcademy. I only bought Angela's course after I knew that, web development was something beyond a hobby. I hope to make it a passion!</p>

        <h3>Computer Building</h3>
        <p>My aunt bought me my first computer when I was aged 10. Most kids would've downloaded games, or started chatting with their friends online. I became fascinated with how everything worked; and immediately took it apart, learning about the different components, and how to repair them.</p>
